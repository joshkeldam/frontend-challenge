# FundingPips Frontend Challenge

Here is a challenge we would like you to complete to help assess and show off your frontend skills. This is an example of a real world problem you would need to solve while working at FundingPips. We do not expect you to spend more than a couple of hours on this project.

## Getting Started
* You will need [NodeJS 18.x+, NodeJS 20.x+](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Please do all of your work in a separate repo.
* Use `npm i` to install the correct packages.
* Use `npm run start` to start the development server.
* You can view the application at http://localhost:3000.

## Application Design
[![AccountsTable](/public/table.png?raw=true "AccountsTable")](https://www.figma.com/design/45CbHh6h8TM32ofFN2t5Ir/Frontend-challenge?node-id=0-1&t=6k0nD9rdnHWkGBdw-1)

## Instructions
* Please recreate the table (illustrated above) utilizing React and Typescript.
* You can view the public design file in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/45CbHh6h8TM32ofFN2t5Ir/Frontend-challenge?node-id=0-1&t=6k0nD9rdnHWkGBdw-1).
* All required fonts can be included directly from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* We want to see how you manage state without using external libraries.
* For styling, you can use any libraries you want; we encourage you to use the libraries you’re most familiar with, as long as you’re writing your own styles (i.e., not utilizing frameworks like Bootstrap, SemanticUI, Blueprint, etc.).
* We are looking at this deliverable as if it was a "miniature product", so therefore, please organize your code as you would expect to do so in a larger application, utilizing best practices for file organization, architecture, documentation, etc.
* The [included data file](/public/data.json?raw=true) includes 500 records to populate.
* Writing tests is not a requirement, but is highly encouraged. You can use any testing framework you are comfortable with.
* Please ignore checkbox in the table design, both in header and in rows.

## Acceptance Criteria
In order to complete the challenge, all acceptance criteria must be met:
* The table should be sortable by each column.
* The table should be able to be paged through using the Previous and Next buttons.
* The search field should filter visible entries based on user or id.
* Please note that we check for AI code generation and anything above 70% match will be considered AI generated.

### Bonus
* Add account button adds new account to the table. (prompts for name and randomizes the rest)

## Submission
When you are ready to submit your solution, please follow these instructions:
* Commit all of your work to your own github repo, including all of your source code, configuration files, etc.
* Send us the link to you public github repo with any comments you have.
